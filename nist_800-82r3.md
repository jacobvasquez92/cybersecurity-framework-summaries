This document, NIST SP 800–82r3, provides comprehensive guidance on securing Operational Technology (OT) systems while considering their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. It expands its scope from previous versions that focused solely on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to cover a broader range of OT, including industrial control systems, building automation systems, transportation systems, and physical access control systems. The document isintended for a diverse audience, including control engineers, system administrators, security consultants, and senior management responsible for OT systems inthe United States. It emphasizes that securing OT systems is critical for the operation of U.S. critical infrastructures, many of which are privately owned and operated, and are often highly interconnected and mutually dependent.


## **Section 1: Introduction**

- **Purpose:** This section introduces the guide’s purpose, which is to provide guidance for securing **operational technology (OT)** systems while addressing
their unique performance, reliability, and safety requirements. It gives an overview of OT systems, identifies common threats and vulnerabilities, and 
recommends security countermeasures. It also presents an OT-tailored security control overlay based on NIST SP 800–53, Rev. 5.    
- **Target Audience:** The document is designed for a varied audience including control engineers, system administrators, IT professionals, security consultants,
  managers, senior management, researchers, analysts, and vendors involved with OT systems. Readers are expected to be familiar with general computer security
  concepts and communication protocols.
- **Real-world Application in the US:** This section sets the stage for how the guidance can be applied to critical infrastructures in the U.S., highlighting the need
 for tailored security solutions due to the increasing integration of IT capabilities into OT, which reduces the traditional isolation of these systems. It
 emphasizes that OT security programs should be part of broader safety and reliability programs due to the direct impact of OT on the physical world, including
 human life and safety, and the nation’s economy.  

## **Section 2: OT Overview**

- **Purpose:** This section provides a foundational understanding of Operational Technology (OT), defining it as programmable systems and devices that interact with
or manage the physical environment. It details various common OT system types, including SCADA, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs),
Building Automation Systems (BAS), Physical Access Control Systems (PACS), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The section also compares the security considerations
of OT and IT systems, highlighting their differences in priorities like safety and availability over confidentiality in OT.
- **Target Audience:** This section is crucial for anyone needing a comprehensive understanding of OT, particularly those involved in its operation, design, and security,
including engineers, IT professionals, and managers across critical infrastructure sectors.
- **Real-world Application in the US:** OT systems are vital to numerous critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S., such as energy, manufacturing, transportation,
and water systems. The evolution of OT systems, driven by integrating IT capabilities, has led to increased connectivity and criticality, necessitating a greater focus
on their adaptability, resilience, safety, and security in real-world applications. Understanding the interdependencies between different OT systems and critical
infrastructures is paramount, as an incident in one sector can cascade and escalate failures across others, potentially affecting the economy and public welfare.

## **Section 3: OT Cybersecurity Program Development**

- **Purpose:** This section outlines the necessity and methodology for developing and implementing a robust OT cybersecurity program. It stresses that such a program
must align with existing IT cybersecurity practices while addressing the unique characteristics and requirements of OT systems, prioritizing safety, availability, integrity,
and confidentiality, in that order. The section emphasizes the importance of integrating security throughout the entire OT system lifecycle, from design and procurement to
maintenance and decommissioning.
- **Target Audience:** This section is intended for senior management, cybersecurity managers, IT and OT cross-functional teams, and anyone responsible for the strategic
- planning, development, and operational oversight of OT cybersecurity within an organization.
- **Real-world Application in the US:** For organizations in the U.S. operating critical infrastructures, developing a defined OT cybersecurity program is essential to
mitigate significant risks such as physical impacts (e.g., personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage) and economic impacts (e.g., production losses, supply
chain disruptions). Establishing a strong business case for cybersecurity investments is critical to gain management buy-in and allocate necessary resources for protecting
these vital systems. This program provides a structured approach to manage risks and ensure the long-term commitment needed for secure OT operations across various industries.

## Section 4: Risk Management for OT Systems**

- **Purpose:** This section details the process of managing security risks specifically for Operational Technology (OT) systems. It adapts the general risk management
framework — framing, assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk — to address the unique characteristics and priorities of OT environments, where safety and availability
are paramount concerns, often outweighing confidentiality.
- **Target Audience:** The content is for organizations and personnel involved in managing risk across all levels (organizational, mission/business process, and system),
including safety, information security, and cyber supply chain risk professionals, particularly those operating critical infrastructure in the US.
- **Real-world Application in the US:** In the U.S., where OT systems are vital for critical infrastructures, effective risk management is crucial to prevent catastrophic
outcomes like loss of life, environmental damage, or widespread economic disruption. The guidance emphasizes integrating cybersecurity considerations into existing safety
and engineering practices, using tools like NIST’s National Vulnerability Database and MITRE ATT&CK for ICS to identify vulnerabilities specific to OT systems. It also
highlights the importance of addressing supply chain risks and ensuring continuous monitoring to adapt to evolving threats and maintain the resilience of critical operations.

## **Section 5: OT Cybersecurity Architecture**

- **Purpose:** This section provides recommendations for designing a security architecture for Operational Technology (OT) environments, primarily focusing on the separation
of OT and corporate IT networks to mitigate unique risks associated with OT communications and performance requirements. It advocates for a “defense-in-depth” strategy, which
involves layering security mechanisms across multiple dimensions: security management, physical security, network security, hardware security, and software security.
- **Target Audience:** This section is intended for security architects, engineers, and IT/OT professionals responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the
cybersecurity infrastructure of OT systems. It is also relevant for managers who need to understand the strategic implications of cybersecurity architecture decisions for
their OT environments.
- **Real-world Application in the US:** The principles outlined are directly applicable to critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S. that rely on OT, such as energy, manufacturing,
and transportation. Implementing network segmentation (e.g., using firewalls and unidirectional gateways) is crucial for protecting these systems from cyberattacks and ensuring
operational continuity. The guidance helps organizations build resilient systems by considering long OT asset lifecycles, integrating proactive loss prevention, and adapting to
emerging technologies like the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).  

## **Section 6: Applying the Cybersecurity Framework to OT**

- **Purpose:** This section provides guidance on applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to Operational Technology (OT) systems. It maps the five core CSF
Functions — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover — to OT-specific considerations, ensuring that cybersecurity activities and outcomes are communicated consistently
across the organization. The section emphasizes tailoring traditional IT cybersecurity practices to account for OT’s unique operational requirements, such as prioritizing
safety and availability.
- **Target Audience:** This section is crucial for cybersecurity professionals, risk managers, and operational personnel in organizations that manage OT systems, particularly
those seeking to align their OT cybersecurity programs with a recognized national framework.
- **Real-world Application in the US:** For U.S. critical infrastructure organizations, applying the CSF to OT provides a structured and consistent approach to managing cyber
risks. It enables better understanding and communication of cybersecurity posture, helping to secure systems that are vital for national and economic security. Key real-world
applications include establishing robust asset management for OT components, implementing tailored access controls (both logical and physical), developing OT-specific incident
response and recovery plans, and ensuring continuous monitoring for anomalies in deterministic OT environments. The guidance promotes a proactive approach to security, recognizing
that OT vulnerabilities can have significant physical and safety consequences.
