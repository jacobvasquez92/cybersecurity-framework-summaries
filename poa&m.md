# Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)

A **Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M)** is a formal document used to track and manage the remediation
of security weaknesses within an organization's information systems. It's a key component of a cybersecurity
risk management and compliance program, especially for government agencies and contractors who must comply
with frameworks like *NIST RMF* and *FedRAMP*.

*POA&M tracking is the process of continuously monitoring the progress of these remediation efforts.*

## **The Purpose of a POA&M**  
A **POA&M** is more than just a list of problems; it is a strategic roadmap. For each identified weakness,   
it details the following:
- **Weakness Description:** A clear explanation of the security deficiency or vulnerability.
- **Corrective Action:** The specific tasks required to fix the weakness.
- **Resources:** The estimated financial and personnel resources needed for the fix.
- **Milestones:** A breakdown of the corrective action into measurable steps.
- **Completion Date:** A realistic deadline for when the weakness will be fully remediated.

## **How POA&M Tracking Works**
Effective POA&M tracking ensures that an organization remains on schedule to fix its security flaws and 
demonstrates due diligence to auditors and authorizing officials. It is a continuous process that involves:
1. **Prioritization:** Weaknesses are not all created equal. They are prioritized based on risk, with high-impact vulnerabilities receiving the most immediate attention and the shortest deadlines.
2. **Regular Reviews:** The POA&M is a "living document" that requires frequent updates. This is often done through scheduled meetings to review the status of each item, confirm progress, and address any roadblocks.
3. **Accountability:** Each POA&M item should have a clear ownerâ€”a specific person or team responsible for its completion. This ensures accountability and drives the remediation process forward.
4. **Documentation:** All progress, changes to timelines, and evidence of remediation are meticulously documented. This is crucial for audit readiness and provides a clear history of how risks are being manage

## **Tools for POA&M Tracking**
While some smaller organizations may use spreadsheets for tracking, this can become complex and prone to error. Larger organizations
often use specialized tools to automate and streamline the process. These include:
- **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Platforms:** Integrated solutions like RSA Archer, ServiceNow, and Onspring are designed to manage the entire risk and compliance lifecycle, including automated POA&M tracking and reporting.
- **Vulnerability Management Platforms:** Tools like Nucleus Security and OpenRMF can automatically ingest vulnerability scan results and create POA&M items, linking the weakness directly to the scan data.
- **Project Management Software:** Some teams use project management tools like Jira to manage POA&M tasks, integrating them into their existing workflows.
