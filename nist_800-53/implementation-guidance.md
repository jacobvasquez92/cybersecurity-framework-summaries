## Key Implementation Steps ðŸ”‘
*Implementing the NIST 800-53 framework is a strategic process that involves several key steps:*

* **Categorize Systems:** First, an organization must categorize its information systems based on the potential impact of a security or privacy event. This is done by assessing the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability as either **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High**. The overall security category is determined by the highest impact level among the three objectives.
* **Select Baselines:** Based on the system's impact categorization, organizations select a corresponding baseline of security and privacy controls from NIST SP 800-53B. This provides a starting point for the required controls.
* **Tailor Controls:** The selected baselines are then tailored to the specific needs of the organization's mission, business functions, and operating environment. This involves:
    * **Scoping:** Removing controls that are not applicable to the system.
    * **Supplementing:** Adding controls or control enhancements to address specific risks not covered in the baseline.
    * **Assigning Values:** Specifying parameters within the controls, such as a time limit for inactivity timeouts.
    * **Identifying Common Controls:** Designating controls that can be implemented once and inherited by multiple systems (e.g., physical security for a data center).
* **Implement Controls:** The tailored controls are then implemented. This step involves a combination of technical, operational, and managerial safeguards.
* **Assess Controls:** After implementation, an organization must assess the effectiveness of the controls to ensure they are working as intended.
* **Authorize the System:** The authorizing official reviews the control assessment results to determine if the risks are acceptable and grants an authorization to operate (ATO).
* **Monitor Continuously:** Security and privacy are not one-time efforts. Organizations must continuously monitor the implemented controls and the system's environment to detect changes, new threats, and vulnerabilities. This ensures the system remains in a secure and compliant state.
