# **NIST 800-53 Control Enhancements**  
Control enhancements are **add-ons to security controls** that provide additional functionality, increase a control's strength, or add assurance. They are designed
to supplement the base controls, providing a more robust level of protection for systems that require greater security.

***

### Purpose and Functionality

The main purpose of control enhancements is to allow organizations to tailor their security posture based on their specific **risk environment**. Instead of a one-size-fits-all 
approach, organizations can start with a baseline of controls (low, moderate, or high impact) and then add specific enhancements where their risk assessments show a need for stronger protections. 

Control enhancements work in conjunction with their corresponding base control. An organization must first implement the base control before adding the enhancement. They provide:

* **Increased Strength**: Enhancements can make a control more difficult to circumvent. For example, an access control might have an enhancement for using multi-factor authentication, which significantly increases the difficulty of unauthorized access.
* **Additional Functionality**: They can add a new, related capability to a base control. For instance, a control for audit logging might have an enhancement to include automated analysis and reporting of audit data.
* **Added Assurance**: Enhancements can provide a higher degree of confidence that a control is operating effectively.

### Example of a Control with Enhancements

A classic example is the **AC-2 Account Management** control. The base control requires an organization to manage system accounts. However, this is a broad requirement. Within this control, there are several enhancements that provide more specific and robust requirements, such as:

* **AC-2 (1): Automated System Account Management**: This enhancement requires the use of automated mechanisms to manage system accounts, such as for creation, modification, and deletion.
* **AC-2 (3): Disable Accounts**: This enhancement specifies that the organization must automatically disable accounts after a period of inactivity.
* **AC-2 (7): Privileged User Accounts**: This enhancement requires that the organization must establish and manage privileged accounts, which have a different level of control and monitoring than standard accounts.
