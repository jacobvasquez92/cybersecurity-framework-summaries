# 20 Control Families and Their Relevance üõ°Ô∏è  

The NIST SP 800-53 control families are a foundational part of the framework, providing a structured way to address 
various areas of cybersecurity risk. 
They are organized to help organizations select and implement the right security and privacy controls for their systems.


## **An outline of the 20 control families, their relevance, and their intended audience:**

**1. Access Control (AC):** Controls for limiting access to a system and its resources. This is relevant to protecting confidentiality and integrity.  
- Audience: Security administrators, IT staff, and system owners.  

**2. Awareness and Training (AT):** Controls to ensure that users are trained on security and privacy policies and procedures. This is relevant to managing human-related risks.
- Audience: All personnel, managers, and training coordinators.  

**3. Audit and Accountability (AU):** Controls to ensure that system activity is logged and auditable. This is crucial for forensic analysis, incident response, and accountability.
- Audience: Auditors, security analysts, and system administrators.

**4. Security Assessment and Authorization (CA):** Controls for assessing the effectiveness of security controls and authorizing the system to operate. This applies to the formal process of risk acceptance.
- Audience: Senior management, authorizing officials, and independent assessors.

**5. Configuration Management (CM):** Controls for establishing and maintaining secure configurations for all system components. This is vital for maintaining system integrity and preventing vulnerabilities.
- Audience: System administrators and DevOps engineers.

*6. Contingency Planning (CP):** Controls for developing and implementing plans for responding to system outages or disasters. This directly addresses the risk to system availability.
- Audience: Disaster recovery teams and business continuity planners.

**7. Identification and Authentication (IA):** Controls to verify the identity of users and devices before granting access. This is a core defense against unauthorized access.
- Audience: Identity and access management (IAM) professionals and IT staff.

**8. Incident Response (IR):** Controls for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. This is critical for minimizing the impact of a breach.
- Audience: Incident response teams and security operations center (SOC) analysts.

**9. Maintenance (MA):** Controls for performing timely and secure system maintenance. This helps to prevent new vulnerabilities from being introduced.
- Audience: Maintenance personnel and system administrators.

**10. Media Protection (MP):** Controls for protecting system media (both digital and physical) from unauthorized access. This addresses the risk of data leakage.
- Audience: Physical security staff and data owners.

**11. Physical and Environmental Protection (PE):** Controls for securing the physical location and environment of information systems. This is a first line of defense against physical threats.
- Audience: Physical security teams and facilities managers.

**12. Planning (PL):** Controls for developing security and privacy plans. This is a management-level function that provides the overall strategic direction for security.
- Audience: Senior management, system owners, and security officers.

**13. Program Management (PM):** Controls for establishing a comprehensive information security and privacy program. This ensures that security is an ongoing, organization-wide effort.
- Audience: Program managers and C-level executives.

**14. Personnel Security (PS):** Controls for screening and managing personnel with access to information systems. This helps to mitigate insider threats.
- Audience: Human resources and security management.

**15. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Processing and Transparency (PT):** Controls for managing the privacy of user data. This is relevant to legal and compliance risks.
- Audience: Privacy officers, data stewards, and legal teams.

**16. Risk Assessment (RA):** Controls for periodically assessing and documenting risks to the system. This is central to the RMF and drives all other security decisions.
- Audience: Risk analysts, security assessors, and business managers.

**17. System and Services Acquisition (SA):** Controls for ensuring security is integrated into the system development life cycle (SDLC). This is relevant to managing supply chain risk.
- Audience: Procurement officers and system developers.

**18. System and Communications Protection (SC):** Controls for protecting system communications and integrity. This includes things like network segmentation and cryptography.
- Audience: Network engineers and security architects.

**19. System and Information Integrity (SI):** Controls for protecting against malicious code and system vulnerabilities. This directly addresses the risk of unauthorized changes or data corruption.
- Audience: System administrators and security professionals.

**20. Supply Chain Risk Management (SR):** Controls for managing the risks associated with third-party products and services. This is a key concern in modern cybersecurity.
- Audience: Procurement teams, vendor managers, and risk analysts.
