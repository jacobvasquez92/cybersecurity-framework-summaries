# **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**
The Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a structured, seven-step process developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 
to help organizations manage cybersecurity risks for information systems. Its primary purpose is to integrate security and privacy into the
entire system development lifecycle, moving away from a traditional compliance-based approach to a more proactive, risk-based one.  

## **The Seven Steps of RMF**  
The RMF provides a continuous and repeatable process to secure an information system. The steps are:  
1. **Prepare:** This initial step involves setting the foundation for risk management. It includes identifying key roles, defining an organizational risk strategy, and establishing a continuous monitoring plan.

2. **Categorize:** You determine the system's impact on the organization based on the potential loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This categorization helps determine the level of security controls needed.

3. **Select:** Based on the system's category, you select a baseline set of security controls from the NIST SP 800-53 catalog. These controls are then tailored to the specific needs and risks of the system.

4. **Implement:** The selected security controls are put into place on the system, and the implementation details are thoroughly documented.

5. **Assess:** An independent assessor evaluates whether the implemented controls are working as intended and are effective in mitigating risk.

6. **Authorize:** A senior official reviews the assessment results and makes a risk-based decision to authorize the system to operate (known as an "Authorization to Operate" or ATO).

7. **Monitor:** The system and its controls are continuously monitored for changes and new threats. This ongoing process ensures the system's security posture remains effective over time

Think of it like building a house: you first **prepare** by creating a blueprint and gathering your tools. You then **categorize** the house's purpose 
(e.g., a simple home or a high-security vault). Based on that, you select the necessary security features like strong doors or alarms. Next, you **implement**
those features. A building inspector then **assesses** your work. A senior official **authorizes** the house as safe to live in, and finally, you **monitor** it for 
maintenance and new risks as time goes on.
