# ACAS, SCAP, & BNA
## Descriptions and Key Takeaways

### 1. ACAS: Assured Compliance Assessment Solution

* **What it is:** ACAS is a suite of information security tools used by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and its agencies for vulnerability scanning and risk assessment.
* **Purpose:** The main goal of ACAS is to provide the DoD with a comprehensive and automated way to monitor, assess, and report on the security posture of its networks and connected IT systems. It helps identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could be exploited by adversaries.
* **How it works:** ACAS is a collection of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software, primarily from Tenable, that includes components for vulnerability scanning (like Nessus), passive network monitoring, and log correlation. It's designed to be compliant with federal cybersecurity standards.
* **Key takeaway:** ACAS is a specific, mandated solution for vulnerability and compliance management within the U.S. military and defense agencies.

### 2. SCAP: Security Content Automation Protocol

* **What it is:** SCAP is a suite of specifications maintained by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It's not a tool itself, but a set of open standards that enable automated vulnerability management, security configuration measurement, and compliance evaluation.
* **Purpose:** SCAP provides a common language and format for communicating security-related information. This allows different security tools from various vendors to "talk" to each other and share data, such as software flaws, security configurations, and vulnerability scores.
* **How it works:** SCAP is built on several other standards, including:
    * **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):** A dictionary of publicly known information security vulnerabilities.
    * **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):** A framework for rating the severity of vulnerabilities.
    * **OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language):** A standard for expressing and sharing security content.
* **Key takeaway:** SCAP is a foundational framework for cybersecurity automation and standardization, ensuring interoperability and consistency across different security products. ACAS, for example, is designed to be SCAP-compliant.

### 3. BNA

* This acronym is less common in a modern cybersecurity context and can refer to a few different things.
* **Historical context:** Historically, BNA stood for "Burroughs Network Architecture," a proprietary networking protocol developed by Unisys. This is largely obsolete in modern IT environments.
* **Modern context:** More recently, "BNA" is a common acronym for a few different organizations or products that might be related to cybersecurity, such as:
    * **Bloomberg BNA:** A media and information company that has published materials on cybersecurity, privacy, and data breach issues.
    * **Nashville International Airport (BNA):** The airport's IT department may have job listings or information about its cybersecurity roles.
    * Other company or product names that use the acronym.

* **Key takeaway:** Unlike ACAS and SCAP, which have specific and well-defined meanings within the cybersecurity domain (especially in the federal and defense sectors), "BNA" is an ambiguous acronym. Its meaning depends entirely on the context in which it's used.
